A informative website that portrays **African Mythology** focusing on some main orixás with their respective Yoruba myths, aiming to increase its visibility without the intention of converting users to the religion. To this end, we provide content that is easy to read and understand, dynamic and very interactive.

# 📌About
This website was a **final project** created in 2018 by a group of 4 students, each one responsible for a task. I was responsible for taking care of all the **design(UI)** and part of the **front-end**.
